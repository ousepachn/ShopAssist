# ShopAssist
This github repo is created for the shopassist app.  This was put together for the LabLabAi Hackathon event that started on Feb 16th 2024

The app is hosted on https://shopassist-lab.streamlit.app/

We also ran a RAG performance evaluation (Triad method) with Truelens.  Initial results can be seen in TrulensEval.pdf
