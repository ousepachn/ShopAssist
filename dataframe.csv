Next is the Clarifying Prebiotic Moisturizer, also from Hero. This is only 13 bucks. This is like the perfect texture. It's moisturizing and makes my skin feel soft. For my post-blemish areas, we're going in with one of my favorite products of all time. This is Rescue Balm. Such a nourishing formula. I just dab this on in the night. In the morning, I am good to go. For a spot treatment, we're keeping it super gentle because my skin is already crispy. Going in with the Mighty Patch Original. Love the Mighty Patch in particular because these don't fall off in the middle of the night. And that's the routine. Quick, easy, simple. You're welcome."

It does smell very strongly of oranges, but overall, love the sunscreen. I didn't even make a review on this because it just pilled immediately. I put it on, tried to put makeup on top of it, pill, pill, pill, city, not for me. This held me down this summer. It is a super lightweight, liquidy mineral sunscreen. Dries down matte.

This spray sunscreen is my favorite spray sunscreen that exists. It's affordable, it's super matte, it doesn't weigh your makeup down. So good. This is their version of the Supergoop Glow Screen, and I think they are pretty identical. Very glowy, tin man vibes, and the invisible sunscreen is great too. No white cast, and it doesn't bug my eyes that much. Solar Mate is gorgeous. It's a little bit of a matte slash skin-like finish. Super, super lightweight, blends in the skin well, doesn't irritate my skin at all. Neutrogena Mineral UV Tint. This stuff is so good. It's affordable, and it's a mineral sunscreen that comes in shades.
