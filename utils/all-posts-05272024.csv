I can‚Äôt believe I never took my mom‚Äôs beauty tips and routines seriously.

Seeing myself represented in traditional/social media has been really healing for my soul.

I was always gaslit into thinking my concerns were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (there‚Äôs nothing normal about bleeding for months on end) or just being pushed pills like birth control and antidepressants (even though multiple bc‚Äôs gave me the most insane mood swings). 

I‚Äôm finally feeling happy in my body and have gotten things to work properly again. I have no idea how pregnancy will change that and honestly I don‚Äôt think I have the energy, patience or mental capacity to figure it out again all while taking care of a whole other human. 

I know damn well that the north american cuIture and healthcare system show very little concern, support, knowledge and appreciate for women‚Äôs health which makes wanting to have a baby less desirable, especially with a preexisting condition like PMDD. I think if there was a change in the culture and our systems women like me wouldn‚Äôt feel so conflicted about the decision. We‚Äôd be more willing to have children cause we‚Äôd be able to get the support, rest and appreciation we deserve. Just because most women go through it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not hard.

It‚Äôs unfortunate so many of us (including the generations before us) were never taught how to be in tune with our emotions and properly communicate them.

@slashieconnects is one of my all time favorite weekends in NYC. It‚Äôs a yearly summit that celebrates South Asian creators, entrepreneurs & small businesses. This was the 5th Slashie Summit of all time, my third time in attendance & second time as a speaker. 

My last Slashie, I was not a speaker but a vendor. The Scene had a stall at Slashie and we gained 325 sign ups for our web app from our 8 hour long stall. This was the highest sign up day, for our business of all time. 

From that moment, to the year before on the CEO panel, or this year on the How I Built This panel - I literally can‚Äôt thank Slashie & @tsakhuja_walia enough for having us + giving so many more South Asian voices a platform.

(Also on a personal note - If It wasn‚Äôt for Slashie I wouldn‚Äôt have met @thezubairshow and therefore my life would be half as exciting so thank you Slashie for giving me one of my closest friends).

The dimly lit ambience and plush motifs, give it a speakeasy / lounge type atmosphere <> meets restaurant experience and we love how these two worlds come together at 9 Jones. You‚Äôre going to want to get there 1533 experience and their caviar bump & bubbles experience for a truly one of a kind night to remember (and if you get lucky, you might just get to share with George & Amal, who are also regulars at this spot). It‚Äôs pretty rare to find a dinner party spot in this part of town but this spot, has mastered that vibe. Make your dinner reservations ‚ú®

We got the following cocktails:

- lychee lovers : delicious, with hints of rose
- Vodka masala : so good and so different than anything we‚Äôve tried
- Old fashioned : delicious and a moment for your instagram

This is a great spot for happy hour with friends post work or to go out on the weekend. Personally we think it‚Äôs rare to find a spot that does bottle service, great happy hours, etc. and still does delicious craft cocktails - and the highlight room absolutely wins for us there. They also have gorgeous panoramic views of the city - despite living here 11 years, we were mesmerized. (PS: They also offer an amazing Happy Hour every¬†Tuesday - Friday from 5PM - 9PM with $5 ros√©.)
.
The perfect itinerary would be to come here around 6/7pm and have an absolute blast as the party turns up till 9/10pm, with their live DJs. Then head downstairs to the restaurant at the same hotel, Sake No Hana for dinner & drinks or the Silver Lining Lounge (also at the Moxy) and then to Loosies for clubbing right next door‚ú®

Personally we love that they took out the ‚Äústuffiness‚Äù typically associated with live band performances, where the guests usually can‚Äôt talk or have a word of their own. The band was most definitely the center of attention, but in a fun and casual way, where the guests also had a chance to talk amongst themselves and not to mention the band members themselves were interacting with the audience the whole evening as well.

thescenenewyork,C5jQq22P4Kn,,"OK, but seriously what is it with laptop free caf√©s especially and we repeat especially when literally no one is sitting inside the caf√© and it is completely empty? 

Caf√© Kitsun√© is cute and serves a good coffee. The aesthetics are on point. We don‚Äôt even need to say it. But they literally lost out on a full sale (and okay also what would have otherwise been completely positive coverage honestly), because they were super strict on the laptop free rule, even when no one was in the caf√©. 

There are so many great cafes but for the work from home ppl like us, who would love to go to a cafe at a non peak time, and work from there, we come to find out that they are actually laptop free. The question really is should cafes change their laptop free rule to specific times? And should this left to the discretion of the barista, that‚Äôs at the time managing the caf√©? For instance, at a super busy time when the caf√© is full, of course you can have a laptop free rule to maintain turnover + more sales, but in an afternoon on a weekday when there‚Äôs no one in the caf√© maybe they should you allow 45 minute to an hour allowances on laptops being out per customer? We get that adding policing on using laptops is not easy but is it worth it if it‚Äôs going to significantly increase sales when the cafe is otherwise empty. There‚Äôs also a really easy way to police this by disconnecting wifi automatically after 1 hour or 45 mins of usage. 

Anyway - what are your thoughts on laptop free cafes? Love it or hate it?
