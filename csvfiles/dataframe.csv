Now we've always made beauty like the first thing, the most important thing to like a person's value, which is super fucked up, but that hasn't really changed. Like it used to be a glow up was like box hair dye and like throwing on a bunch of makeup. And that's honestly kind of a fun vibe. Now a glow up is fillers, Botox, $3,000 hair extensions.

Okay, I am back and I have my final thoughts. Okay, in terms of hydration, I think she does a pretty good job. She is a definitely thick textured lip balm, so she stays on even as you kind of eat and drink. A little sticky, nothing crazy, but you know, she's a little goopy. I actually think this feels on the lips kind of like a super creamy lipstick. And I personally prefer my moms to be a little bit lighter, but I still think it's a great formula.

Been working on this for months! I‚Äôm joining Ridge as chief creative partner and joining the board.

Honestly they‚Äôre the perfect partner to start making actual products. Big and experienced enough to have the manufacturing expertise to turn ideas into reality BUT not too big that they‚Äôre unwilling to listen and be nimble. I have a lot of product ideas, and together we‚Äôre going to actually make them happen

Also on this crazy journey as a creator I‚Äôve been lucky enough to open doors along the way, and this feels like a great signal for future creators to be able to do the same.

116,mkbhd,C1cRCfwLO_4,,"I love electric cars, but as I've said on the Auto Focus channel there are certain TYPES of vehicles that with today's tech are BEST when made electric. Take a luxury sedan - what do you want from the best one? It better be super smooth, comfortable, quiet (and probably expensive). A new electric version? Literally the smoothest, quietest, most spacious version ever. (also probably expensive). Total win across the board. 

But sports cars are not one of those things. Yet. The power is there, duh, but there's also a ton of weight that comes with it. And the best sports car across the board rivers best when it's lighter, nimble and reliable. The gap is closing (and hybrids are getting VERY good) out the apex sports car is still not fully electric. 

Honestly I was nervous to get it after watching basically every review on the internet proclaiming this to be the ""best car ever created"" and ""too good"" but the professionals were on to something. I'm not ready to say it's the best car ever made, but most of its traits are already top 5% of any car I've ever experienced: Handling, steering feel, balance, physical switches, interior build quality, speakers, acceleration (ok it's 8/10ths as quick as PLAID)

The tech is actually kinda bad compared to new EVs. The backup camera is weak, there's no phone key, the app does almost nothing, no dashcam, wireless CarPlay/Android Auto are welcome but also honestly still not very good. I don't even think that's a hot take.

I've compared smartphones to the Porsche 911's incremental improvement model for years. When the category is young, we call it lazy. When the category is mature, we call it refinement. And I'm only 700 miles in, but damn this car is REFINED as hell.

That means if it hits a cyclist or a pedestrian, it's not going to crumple or dent in a way that actually softens the blow for impact and makes it more safe. So that Elon quote, that if you're ever in an argument with another car, you'll win is probably true, but the whole bumper must be able to absorb energy to protect pedestrians rule in Europe is not going away anytime soon."

Is what a shocking number of you seem to actually believe just based on the reactions to the time I tweeted about it. So let me just break down what's actually happening and then we can be the judge of it. The laws of chemistry say that batteries naturally degrade over time. And so the maximum power that they can output slowly goes down over time. So Apple chose to do is underclock the CPU of iPhones with older degraded batteries to prevent them from hitting the lower battery power limit. The problem is they did this for a while without telling anyone. So that's where the conspiracy sort of started years ago. They eventually got called out publicly and had to admit it and paid a hundred plus million dollar lawsuit out over it. But now if your old iPhone experiences an unexpected shutdown due to the battery not being able to supply enough power, a new setting appears that literally gives you the option to keep running at full speeds anyway. But at the end of the day, this behavior is built into the iPhone you already have, not in the software update waiting for you. So go ahead and update your phone for security's sake. Also, if you have an old slow phone, consider replacing the battery instead of the whole phone. It literally gets faster again. You're welcome. You're welcome.","Updating your iPhone software lets Apple nuke your phone to make you buy a new phone. Is what a shocking number of you seem to actually believe just based on the reactions to the time I tweeted about it. So let me just break down what's actually happening and then we can be the judge of it. The laws of chemistry say that batteries naturally degrade over time. And so the maximum power that they can output slowly goes down over time. So Apple chose to do is underclock the CPU of iPhones with older degraded batteries to prevent them from hitting the lower battery power limit. The problem is they did this for a while without telling anyone. So that's where the conspiracy sort of started years ago.

So first of all, the new iPhones. iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max. All these models have matching Dynamic Island now, which is sick, but they've all switched to USB Type-C, finally. Goodbye, lightning. It's crazy. We knew this was coming, but it's still wild to see an iPhone in person with USB. You can now finally charge your iPad, your laptop, and your iPhone, and the new AirPods, and your friend's Android phone, all with the same cable. The Pro iPhones also now get a lighter, stronger titanium rail, and faster 3 nanometer chip, and there's some camera improvements that we'll have to test, like every year. And the Pro Max also gets the new 5x telephoto camera. Coolest thing, though, in my opinion. The mute switch is gone from the Pros, and there's a customizable action button instead, and it can do a bunch of stuff more than I expected, including muting your phone. And then we also got some new Apple Watches. It's the Series 9 and the Ultra 2. They both look exactly the same as last year, but there is a much improved, faster chip under the hood, and they are allegedly Apple's first completely carbon neutral product. There are way more details, though, so get subscribed to make sure you see the full video and the hands-on with the new iPhones.","Here's everything you need to know that just got announced at Apple's Wunderlist event, 2023.
