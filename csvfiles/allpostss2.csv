In the mornings, you're gonna use this combo. This is not negotiable. You're gonna use the Lightning One from Hero on your spots. It's a targeted spot treatment. And you can't just go hard on acids. Your skin is gonna freak out. It's not gonna do what you want it to do. That's why you're gonna pair it with the Propolis Light Ampoule from COSRX. I've tried them all. This one is the best.

Don't forget prevention is just as important. The second you see a spot, slap a pimple patch on it. Do not touch your face. Do not choke and pop it.

My acne heals so much better when I use this. That's everything you'll need. Good luck.","If you wanna get rid of dark spots, here's what you're gonna do. Retinoid of your choice, every single night. This one from The Ordinary is great. If this is too strong for you, use Ozlike Acid instead. If your dark spots are X Games mode, use them both together, just alternate nights. Retinoid has a little bit of a purge period. It is absolutely worth it if you wanna get rid of those scars quickly. In the mornings, you're gonna use this combo. This is not negotiable. You're gonna use the Lightning One from Hero on your spots. It's a targeted spot treatment. And you can't just go hard on acids. Your skin is gonna freak out.

Not a crazy amount of shine, but still a considerable amount of shine. It's definitely on the thicker side, and it really does hydrate your lips all day. Super smooth, 12 bucks. Really like this one.

It is so shiny, not sticky, and it actually lasts quite a while on the lips. But I wouldn't buy these. At least not right now. Basically, the stopper is too large, so whenever I put these in my bag, they just absolutely explode everywhere. The mask doesn't, because it's a little bit thicker, but the oil will, it will leak. However, I did talk to their team, and they are reducing the size of the stopper, so hopefully that stops any leakage problems. When they make that update, this will be in my bag at all times.

I had to see a couple before I found one that was willing to work with me to get to my goals. Because literally the first couple that I saw were all like, Accutane is your only option. And I was like, fuck that. I wanted to try other things before Accutane. Accutane is not like a fuck that kind of situation. I know lots of people who have had success with Accutane. I just didn't want that to be my first option. But anyway, when I found the derm, she was amazing. And she was the one who enlightened me about tretinoin and spironolactone. And that was really the key to my success. Second thing is I really wish I had known how long it was going to take. You hear a lot of people online talk about overnight miracle cures. When you were dealing with stubborn hormonal cystic acne, those huge bumps that you get along your jaw, those are not going to go away overnight. And any treatment that you put on top of them, it's not getting deep enough to actually solve the root of the problem. To get from full face of cystic acne to absolute zero, it took me eight months. Eight long months. And unfortunately on tretinoin, there is a long purge period where it's like four full months of worse acne than I had before. And then there was obviously some tweaking my own skincare routine to make sure that everything was working together. So when you start something, don't expect an overnight miracle. Give things at least a month to work. And we're talking about retinoids, three months to work. And the last thing is to be nicer to yourself. This is the hardest part, honestly, because when you are dealing with acne, it's so visible. It feels like everyone can see what you're going through and it can be really disheartening and discouraging. It can feel really isolating if you don't know other people who are dealing with the same thing. And people can be really shitty about it. I've had bosses comment on my acne before. And that's like... And when we are angry at ourself, when we are upset with ourself, we tend to make more rash decisions. So we tend to do things like throw a bunch of different products at our face and burn our skin off. I have definitely done that a bunch of times. The craziest thing being out of it for a couple of years and having relatively clear skin for a couple of years is that I speak to my friends and my family and literally no one remembers that I had acne. Like no one remembers that I had acne. That's how unimportant it was in their lives. And even though it seemed like such a huge deal to me at the time, to the people who are the most important of me, it wasn't even a blip. It was not something that they even think about or thought about. Skin goes in cycles. There are gonna be time periods where you have no acne and there are time periods when you are gonna have just a random cyst that pops up and that still happens to me years later. And it's really important to be kind and to be gentle to yourself in those moments because having acne does not make you any less worthy or deserving of love. You deserve to feel beautiful and validated no matter what state your skin is in. So give yourself a little bit of grace and a little bit of kindness. And if you wanna talk about it, I'm here.

And what do we have here? On the packaging, it says use up to twice a day, which is psychotic. Here's what I would recommend instead if you are still looking for an exfoliating toner. If you're a BHA girly, but you don't want something that's gonna rip your face off, the pore release from Hero, excellent. Two to three times a week is all you need. Maybe salicylic acid is not your vibe. It is not my vibe. And you wanna go with AHAs instead. This is lactic acid and azelaic acid, which if you don't know, that is one of the best. I don't know why I said it like that. I am so sorry. Anyway, this is a strong boy. I would use this maybe one time a day, but it's definitely going to clear out all of your pores. And even Miss Paula knows this is not a good idea because they literally made a Sensib's conversion. This is a medium strength BHA toner. You can still use this once or twice a day. And you are going to get all that blackhead clearing without all of the irritation. And look, I get it. Brands want you to use their product more because then you have to go and repurchase again. But I just think saying to use this two times a day is irresponsible. Like maybe once or twice a week for most people. If you have insanely oily skin, maybe you can use this twice a day, but I don't know your life. Anyway, I hope this helps. Okay, love you. Bye.","I burned my face about a month or two ago.

Last year was my first year going and I went for work with Neutrogena, which was amazing, such an amazing opportunity. But oh my God, the anxiety I was having because literally everyone who goes to Coachella looks like an Instagram model and I'm very much not an Instagram model. So I was being really hard on myself about picking out all the best outfits, about getting a bunch of facials before so my skin would look really good. And yeah, just putting a bunch of unnecessary pressure on myself to try and conform to the beauty standards that I don't really fit into. And did all of my worst nightmares come true and a video of me go mega super viral where literally everyone in the comments was fat shaming me? Absolutely that happened. Okay, but here's the thing about creating space for yourself is you actually have to go and take up space. So by me being there and feeling a little uncomfortable, but literally all I had to do was show up and that means the next person who is maybe feeling a little weird about being old or not looking the part to go to Coachella can look at my content and be like, well, fuck, she did it. I can fucking do it. So anyway, this year everyone's like, Coachella isn't cool anymore. Showing up is cringey and if you do show up, you should only wear jeans and a t-shirt because trying isn't cool. So if you are someone who really likes to dress up, you might be seeing all that discourse online and being like, oh my God, I should tone it down. I should tone the fuck down. I should chill out a little bit. And my response to you would be, fuck that. You should do what you want. You're paying hundreds or thousands of dollars to be here and you should do exactly what you want in order to have a good time. You are allowed to show up and do exactly what you wanna do. And literally no one can tell you any different. And it might seem silly, but you doing that makes it easier for the next person. And I think when we're early on, on our confidence journey, a lot of times people are like, well, you're just as beautiful as they are. And I'm like, girl, like I'm hot, but I'm like not Bella Hadid and that's like not helpful. Instead, I prefer to say, I am just as worthy of being here as Bella Hadid is. I'm just as worthy of being here as anyone else is. And again, this is not Coachella specific advice. This can be for literally anything. So don't be afraid, bitch. Okay? Anyway, here's the fit.

Spoiler alert, if you don't wanna hear me talking about colon stuff, then what are you doing here? So basically for 10 years, every time I used the restroom, I would bleed. And for some reason, I thought that was normal. And actually another content creator on here and I were at an event and I mentioned it to her. I don't know why or how it came up, honestly. But she was like, girl, you need to CGI. And honestly, like the moment she said something to me, like something clicked in my brain because like colorectal cancer is like, has doubled in young people in the last few years. So then I was like, fuck, maybe it is something serious. I should probably go. So I went to the GI. And basically the GI was like, yeah, let's do colonoscopy and like figure some stuff out. And I like had a panic attack and like cried in her office. As far as I can remember, I've always been terrified of IVs. I just don't like the idea of like something in my body. And then I was definitely afraid of being put under. I must've emailed her like a hundred times with like a million questions before my appointment. But she was pretty reassuring. She was like, essentially like, it's like a twilight sleep. So we're not putting like fully, fully under. You just like won't remember anything. So anyway, it is like the day of the prep. And the prep is what everyone has been telling me is like the worst part. That's where you have to like either drink laxatives or like take laxative pills and like shit your brains out for like 12 hours. I don't know. I was more scared for the going under part, but everyone was like, the prep is much worse. So I picked up all my prep stuff and you're basically like on a clear liquid fast for that day, clear chicken broth, Gatorade. Basically you have to be like fully clear so they can see what's going on. And yeah, that like definitely was not fun, but I was more afraid of like the actual procedure. And that's what was giving me a lot of anxiety. So I wasn't like so focused on stomach issues. So anyway, my appointment was like 9 a.m. I had been up all night and my fiance drops me off and I like signed some paperwork, which I think is kind of shitty that they make you do that in the morning, like when you're delirious and you haven't eaten for 24 hours. But anyway, you signed some paperwork and then they brought me to the room. And of course, cue my absolute meltdown. Like I am sobbing. I'm holding my GI's hand. The anesthesiologist is like, you're okay. Like everything's gonna be fine. Like it's just gonna feel like a nap. They put the like breathing tube on and the anesthesiologist is like, okay, I'm gonna count down from 10 and by the time I hit one, you'll be asleep. And I'm just like silently crying. And the next thing I knew I was up and I was in the other room and it was just as easy as that. It felt like I literally just like laid down for an hour. Oh my God, and you wake up feeling so good, like so well rested. And my fiance was there in the room and he was like, all right, let's go get some food. I just like really made it out to be this like huge thing in my mind when literally it was like a 10 minute nap, like 10 minute procedure. And then I was totally fine after. No pain, no issues. Like I was good to like get up and walk around. I was like still a little high from the drugs. And the next day I got the all clear. They didn't find anything. Nothing was wrong with me. They were like, it's just regular old fissures and hemorrhoids and that's totally fine. But if there had been anything, that would have been like a life saving procedure. Like they can find really small pieces of cancer and literally just laser them off like right there, done. So anyway, if me, big baby can get a colonoscopy and have it be totally fine. If there are any issues going on with you, I would highly recommend seeing a GI and getting it checked out because it can seriously be life saving. And if you guys have any questions about the procedure or about the prep, let me know in the comments down below and I will do my best to hold your hand through it because I have been there.

Welcome to my bathroom. I just took a shower and washed my face and let's do some skincare. So the tea with washing your face is you don't have to really in the morning, particularly if you have dry skin. I like to just to get off everything from the night before and also I'm a night sweater. So I would like to remove that before I put more skincare on top. You can totally just do water. You don't actually have to wash your face in the morning unless you're oily, in which case do. I really like to use toner. Toner adds a little like extra hydration in the morning, but toner also helps your skincare penetrate a little bit better. You can also just use water, but again, I like to add a little bit of hydration when I can because my skin is very dry. Okay, don't hate me, but I have three serums that I apply in the morning. You do not have to apply three serums. My skin can take a lot because it's dry and it sucks up everything. So I don't really have issues with pilling typically, but if you are someone who has oilier skin, you probably only want to use one serum in the morning, but I use three. I'm gonna explain them all. And the order in which you go with your serums is typically thinnest to thickest or your highest percentage of actives first. Okay, so the first serum is an age-supporting serum. This is one from The Ordinary. And you've probably heard of peptides in passing. Essentially, peptides just help to produce collagen, plump up the skin, and also they help to improve your skin barrier. And you might be like, what is a skin barrier? So basically it's the outermost layer of your skin, which is held together with lipids, which are like fats and oils, and they help keep your skin chill and calm and protect it from outside aggressors. So when you have a damaged skin barrier, you might experience more acne, redness, inflammation, texture, those kinds of things. That's why it's so important, even if you're acne prone like me, to continue to hydrate the skin and to use occlusives that protect that skin barrier or else you are gonna break out more. Sorry if that was a lot. Okay, second one. We are using the COSRX Propolis Ampoule. This does not have actives in it. This is essentially just a hydrator and it also helps with wound healing. So if you're acne prone or you're dealing with acne scarring, this is a great one to add. Y'all were offended that I didn't take it down the neck. I just cut before I take it down the neck because it's kind of weird. I don't know. Lots of cues about whether or not you can mix actives and what actives you can mix. So this has copper peptides in it, which is really strong. You don't wanna use that with anything else. And honestly, as a general rule of thumb, when it comes to skincare, you kind of only wanna use one active at a time, like one primary active. So I am gonna go in with Slushie, which is like a moisturizer slash serum. And this does have actives in it, but it's a blend. So this has like hyaluronic acid, which kind of plays well with everyone. And then the actives that are in here are pretty low percentage. So I don't have to worry too much about this messing with anything else in my routine. And kind of same goes for moisturizers with actives. Typically, people who are formulating like moisturizers know that you're gonna use this with a serum most likely. So they're not gonna put a high percentage of actives in this, because they know it's just gonna fuck up your skin barrier, be too strong for your skin to handle. So you don't really have to worry about things like niacinamide or vitamin C when they've been formulated in a moisturizer, because you know that they're gonna be a pretty low percentage. Okay, next we're gonna do eye cream. This is not a necessary step. You could definitely just use a moisturizer, but I like to use an eye cream just because my under eyes are sensitive and because I will get malaria sometimes if I put like a heavier cream underneath my eyes. Oh wait, sorry, back to moisturizer for a second. Okay, if you have oily skin and you're not moisturizing, you're doing something wrong. I actually used to have oily skin back in the day before I started taking spironolactone and tretinoin, both of which like made my skin dry. But when I started using like a heavier night cream, every night it really made a difference in like my oil production. Because again, when your skin barrier is damaged, your skin is going to produce more oil in order to protect that barrier. So you wanna make sure that you're moisturizing. And sunscreen, obviously, this is like the most important step in your morning routine. If you were doing nothing else, you should be applying sunscreen because like those copper peptides I used, all those hydrators I used, if I wasn't using a sunscreen, all of those are kind of pointless. It wasn't until I started like using sunscreen and using a lot of sunscreen regularly that I really saw a difference in like my dark spots. So hyperpigmentation can't really heal if the sun is making them darker every single time that you're in daylight. And I really prefer using a mineral sunscreen just because my eyes are really sensitive. Like with mineral sunscreen, you can really get all up in your eyes. But a lot of mineral sunscreens tend to be on the heavier side. So keep that in mind if you're somebody who's oily or you might prefer chemical. Or if you have deeper skin, usually mineral sunscreen come with some kind of white cast unless it's tinted. And if that was too much for you, just sunscreen is enough in the morning. Seriously. I also find that when people are complaining about their sunscreen breaking out, it's because they're not taking it off at night properly. So you really wanna double cleanse when you use sunscreen. That's all I'm saying. Okay, that's it. This is my skin. I hope this was helpful. Okay, bye.","Hi, morning. Welcome to my bathroom. I just took a shower and washed my face and let's do some skincare.

Scalp Massages There are tons of tools you can use for your scalp massages, but your fingers will do just a fine job. If you're someone who's going through an extreme amount of hair loss, you want to skip the oil. Instead, focus on gently massaging your scalp 4-5 minutes a day and we're going to work with the natural oils that your scalp is going to be producing. Start adding amla to your diet. A lot of people don't understand the importance of amla, also known as the Indian gooseberry. It contains minerals, vitamins, and phytonutrients when applied topically on the scalp. When combined with a massage, it increases blood circulation and helps to deliver more nutrients and oxygens to the follicles. When you consume amla internally, it contains vitamin C that helps to stimulate the production of collagen in our body, making the hair growth not only faster, but also making your hair thicker. Amla also contains essential fatty acids, iron, carotene, which also makes your hair stronger, thicker, shinier, and voluminous. This is one of the most underrated tips for healthy, strong, and voluminous hair. We all take it for granted and no one pays attention to it. An abbreviation from this can disrupt the hair growth cycle, causing the follicles to enter the shedding phase prematurely. A good night's sleep increases blood flow, delivering adequate amount of oxygen and nutrients to the scalp, which not only helps you with the hair growth, but it also makes your hair thicker and shinier.

If you choose to oil pull after you brush your teeth, make sure you rinse your mouth with warm water and salt because you do not want any of those toxins, also known as metabolic waste, in your mouth to go back to your gut.

I can‚Äôt believe I never took my mom‚Äôs beauty tips and routines seriously. Growing up I was always so embarrassed of my culture because there was no representation in the media of anyone that looked like me or that followed Indian traditions. Seeing myself represented in traditional/social media has been really healing for my soul. It makes my heart happy that people (including myself) are coming to appreciate and enjoy everything that South Asian cultures have to offer.

Cause I'm someone who never eats the crust, but at Fourth Night on the Fire, I'll make an exception. Their Firestone pizza is to die for. The dough is aged for four days, making it soft and airy on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside. It's literally perfection. And as you can tell, they don't hold back on the toppings. Personally, I prefer the regular pizza over the Brooklyn, but they were both delicious. We also got the Real American Hero Sandwich and let me tell you, this thing was loaded. The ingredients were really fresh and the bread, again, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. It did not disappoint.

Cause I'm someone who never eats the crust, but at Fourth Night on the Fire, I'll make an exception. Their Firestone pizza is to die for. The dough is aged for four days, making it soft and airy on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside. It's literally perfection. And as you can tell, they don't hold back on the toppings. Personally, I prefer the regular pizza over the Brooklyn, but they were both delicious. We also got the Real American Hero Sandwich and let me tell you, this thing was loaded. The ingredients were really fresh and the bread, again, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. It did not disappoint.

For years I dealt with issues with my reproductive system and was never taken seriously. I was always gaslit into thinking my concerns were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (there‚Äôs nothing normal about bleeding for months on end) or just being pushed pills like birth control and antidepressants (even though multiple bc‚Äôs gave me the most insane mood swings). 

I‚Äôm finally feeling happy in my body and have gotten things to work properly again. I have no idea how pregnancy will change that and honestly I don‚Äôt think I have the energy, patience or mental capacity to figure it out again all while taking care of a whole other human. 

I know damn well that the north american cuIture and healthcare system show very little concern, support, knowledge and appreciate for women‚Äôs health which makes wanting to have a baby less desirable, especially with a preexisting condition like PMDD. I think if there was a change in the culture and our systems women like me wouldn‚Äôt feel so conflicted about the decision. We‚Äôd be more willing to have children cause we‚Äôd be able to get the support, rest and appreciation we deserve. Just because most women go through it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not hard.

You can skip this step if this is not a problem for you. Apply some mascara, a bit of powder blush, and finally a lip balm or lip oil. Set everything with the Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray so that it doesn't budge even if you sweat. And that's it! See you at the gym! Bye, love you!"

Because we're insane! I'm just kidding. Let me break it down for you. So for a lot of South Asian cultures, it's important to get married by a certain time. Let's just assume the average wedding start time is 10 a.m. Working backwards from there, you'll probably need to be at the hall for 9-9.30 a.m. which allows guests to eat, get settled in, and also time for the Bharat if you're going to have one. Now you need to count an hour to an hour and a half for photos and any rituals that need to be performed before you leave the house, which brings you to about 7 a.m. And then I'd say it takes approximately 3 hours to get ready. This includes hair, makeup, and outfit. Remember, putting on a sari, draping a dupatta on your head, and setting tikkas can take way longer than expected sometimes. If multiple people are getting their hair and makeup professionally done, then the artist can't work on everyone at once, so some people need to start earlier than others. On top of that, you might need to travel to someone's house to get ready and then travel to the wedding house before you leave for the hall. So all of that brings you to around 4 a.m. And then I would add about an hour of buffer time because things always run late and you're also moving at a super slow pace because you're so tired. Now, not everyone gets up that early. It's mainly just the women that are close to the bride or groom because they're needed at the wedding house before heading out to the actual wedding. And this is all done after we've already attended multiple events before the wedding day, so trust me when I say you easily need a week to recover from an Indian wedding.","Why do we wake up at 3 a.m. to get ready for an Indian wedding?

If you're draping a dupatta on your head, make sure it is lightweight. As much as a heavy dupatta looks nice, trust me, you're gonna have a headache and feel overstimulated by the end of the day. Two, do not opt for an updo or bold glam if that's not your style. You're gonna feel uncomfortable and that will show in your pictures. Three, bring your blouse, jewelry, and dupatta to your bridal trial so that you can get a full picture of what you'll look like. Especially if you're someone that likes a more simple look, you need to find a good balance between glam and comfortability. Indian bridal outfits and jewelry are pretty extravagant, so you need the glam to match. Otherwise, it'll look like the outfit is wearing you. Four, whenever you're getting your hair and makeup done, make sure your top can come off from the bottom because that shit is not coming off over your head. Five, eat in the morning because once that wedding starts, there is no guarantee you'll get food after that. Six, practice sitting and walking in your lehenga because that shit is big and heavy and you don't want to fall. You're gonna kick the front of your lehenga and then step so you don't trip. Seven, this applies to grooms too. Remember to smile and have fun. I know that sounds obvious, but when you're tired, nervous, and overwhelmed, that's easy to forget. There are so many cameras on you and you don't want to look miserable. Eight, start your mending much earlier than the event so that you can actually enjoy the party. Nine, less bridesmaids, less drama. I'm not even gonna explain that one. Also, be mindful that bridesmaids and people have a life and financial obligations outside of your wedding. Last but not least, contrary to popular belief, this is not the best, most important day of your life. This is just one of many amazing, important days in your life. Emotions will run high, fights will be had, and things will go wrong. Do not sweat the little things. And don't make your wedding your whole personality. Trust me, you're just as interesting without it. If you have any more tips, drop them in the comments, and I'm wishing you all the best for your wedding. Okay, love you.

So I'm going to show you an eyeshadow look that is so quick and easy but looks like you put in a lot of effort. We're going to start with a blending brush and a light matte brown eyeshadow and blend that out all over your crease. With that same brush, you're going to use a dark brown matte eyeshadow and blend that out in your outer corner and crease. Next, use your finger to take a shimmery eyeshadow and apply it all over your lid. I'm using this Pat McGrath palette. Also, don't go buying everything I'm using. You can definitely achieve this look with whatever you have. Wedding season is expensive enough. You don't need to go spend more money. Then you're going to use a glitter topper and apply this all over the lid to create this beautiful, subtle sparkle on your eye. Next, you're going to create a wing only on the outer corner of your eye. And then tightline so it looks like your eyeliner goes all the way through. If you guys want an eyeliner tutorial, let me know. Add a bit of eyeliner on the bottom as well. Smudge it out using a small pencil brush and dark brown eyeshadow. Doing your eyeliner like this helps your lashes stand out so you don't need falsies. And if you want to be a little more extra, you can pop a highlight into your inner corner. And then finish setting everything with the Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray so that nothing budges. And that's all there is to it.

Next, figure out where you want the dupatta to sit on your head and mark out where you want to sew in the clips. When placing the clip on your dupatta, you want to make sure that the side of the clip that opens up is facing down towards your dupatta so that you can easily slide it into your hair and snap it into place.

How does that make any sense? Why should you be forced to love someone that constantly mistreats you and takes no accountability for it? Often that child ends up learning that abuse is equal to love and that their boundaries, needs, and wants don't matter. The parent-child relationship is the only type of relationship where one party, the parent, is always expected to give more than the other party, the child. Why? Because when you choose to be a parent, you are signing up to provide that child with emotional and physical safety and security, not the other way around. And it terrifies me how many parents don't understand that. I think parenting is the hardest job in the world and that most parents aren't actually ready for the responsibility, mainly because they haven't worked through their own traumas. When your traumas stunt you, causing you to lack a level of emotional intelligence it requires to raise a child, it's easier to demand love, respect, and gratitude from your kid than to actually teach it. Eventually, once that kid turns into an adult, these demands begin to develop an underlying feeling of resentment, guilt, anger, and shame and so the relationship starts to dwindle and as a parent you're left wondering what happened. Not realizing the love, respect, and gratitude you instilled in them was manufactured through fear, guilt, and shame. It was never fully genuine. None of this is to blame parents, after all, no one is perfect and parenting is hard, but I do think it's important to question if the values and emotions instilled in a child were genuine or manufactured. And if they were manufactured, what work have you done that allows you to hold space for both your lived experiences?","It's interesting that we expect children to provide unconditional love to a parent whose love is very conditional.

The consistency behind showing up for yourself when you don‚Äôt feel like it. The effort in becoming a better person even though the process can be rough. All of which is important to create a more holistic approach to self care. 

I‚Äôve had quite a few sessions with @reyshrituals now and let me tell you it‚Äôs been an incredible experience. Not only does she offer reiki but she does it while also providing the most incredible scalp massage and reflexology session. When I tell you I fall asleep every time I‚Äôm not even joking.

Through self-care, I realized that I wasn't this super motivated hustler that I thought I was and instead that personality trait of mine was actually just a trauma response. I had become a workaholic to escape my reality and I didn't even realize how damaging it was because of how much we praise hustle culture. I was taught that if I wasn't productive, I was useless. If I wasn't overachieving, then I wasn't deserving of love and validation. So I basically just worked myself to the point of sickness. At 25, I discovered Reiki and that's when I started doing my shadow work. Reiki is a form of spiritual healing that helps align the energies in your body. It allowed me to create space to address the traumas that lingered within me. Through Reiki, I started to understand that self-care isn't always fun and relaxing. It's also hard work. It's consistently showing up for yourself in ways that aren't necessarily enjoyable like going to therapy, eating healthy, or working out. It's breaking cycles and healing your inner child. It's about doing the work to make yourself a better person even though you know the process can be rough. And while taking time to relax and unwind is an important part of self-care, it's not a sustainable practice. If you don't do the shadow work, you'll find yourself chasing serenity instead of embodying it. I know it's hard to slow down and put yourself first because we've been taught otherwise but this is your sign to do self-care in all forms. Trust me, it's worth it.

I don't think people realize that when you place shame, guilt, and fear around sex, nothing good ever comes out of it. There's so many directions I can go with this, but I want to focus on two. The first, society always promotes this rhetoric that men biologically have more sexual needs that have to be met. If that's true, who are they expecting to meet these needs if women are meant to be celibate? With that thinking, men would also need to be celibate, but for some reason, they're not nearly as reprimanded about it. Like, you don't think suppressing women from expressing their sexuality while simultaneously upholding this idea that men need sex isn't going to lead to more things like SA? You can't see how that would correlate to victim blaming when it comes to SA because we've created this dialogue that it's okay for men to want it, and it's a woman's job to keep it from them. So if the man got it, that means the woman didn't do her job, right? Now let's focus on women who have been taught engaging in sex damages their reputation because if that's all they know, now they associate sex with feelings of shame, guilt, and fear, which creates so many problems. They may have trouble dating when they're older. They may rebel against the idea of celibacy and practice unsafe sex. They may have a harder time reporting SA because they don't want to be seen as used or dirty. They'll have a harder time asking for pleasure from their partner because they don't know what they want or they just feel too ashamed to ask. There's also so many times where people can find themselves sexually incompatible with their partner, and how awful would that be to find out after you've committed yourself to someone forever? I'm not saying go and have sex with everyone. I'm saying choosing whether or not to have sex before marriage is a personal decision, not a societal one, and you shouldn't be shamed for whatever you decide. The conversation around sex should never be an all-or-nothing approach.

Like the pure anxiety and stress I'd have trying to come up with these excuses. On top of that, I know my parents aren't dumb. I'm sure they knew a boy gave it to me, but the idea of openly talking about a relationship made everyone want to throw up, so we would all just play dumb and pray the conversation would never come up. And all of this is not to say I'm expecting some big gifts, but it's nice to finally feel like you can openly be romantic with your partner without stressing about how to explain it to your parents. Anyone else experience this? Anyways, Happy Valentine's Day. That is, if you're able to celebrate it."
128,hemali.mistry,C3I0piBvM9-,,"Learning to express my emotions in general, but especially towards my parents, was so difficult. In my early 20s I cringed at the the thought of sharing my feelings which is funny cause now I over share online üòÇ As I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve started to understand the value of communication and the power of words. It‚Äôs unfortunate so many of us (including the generations before us) were never taught how to be in tune with our emotions and properly communicate them. Breaking cycles isn‚Äôt easy, in fact it‚Äôs very uncomfortable, but always remember change is not an event, it‚Äôs a process. ‚ù§Ô∏è Do you find it hard to share your feelings with your parents?

I felt so much guilt, shame, and sadness for choosing my happiness over them, but I just couldn't bring myself to talk to them. It felt so cringey. So I decided to write them a letter. I left it under a pillow the day I moved out and told them about it later because I didn't want to face them after they read it. In the letter, I shared how much I loved and appreciated them. I talked about all the lessons and great qualities they instilled in me and, most importantly, that they needed to trust they did a good job raising me to know that I am capable of making my own decisions and now it was time for them to let go and let me be an adult.

129,hemali.mistry,C3BaUp7P3Oc,,"I know this is a sensitive topic but I‚Äôve met so many people with emotionally manipulative parents (especially immigrant parents) and they don‚Äôt realize this is a form of abuse so I wanted to talk about it. This type of emotional abuse can lead one into living a life operated by fear, guilt and shame. If this is something you‚Äôre going through I just want to remind you there is a very big difference between caring/empathetic towards your parents and being responsible for their well being.

There are so many parents out there that emotionally manipulate their children by placing the responsibility of their physical or mental health on their child. Like the child may just want to do some regular shit, but it's against what the parents believe. So they use their health problems against the child. And I find this happens more and more often as the child gets older and the parents start to lose control over what that child can or cannot do because they're becoming more independent. It's especially common within a parent and adult child relationship. So for example, you may have a parent that's like, oh, don't move out because you know your mom has a heart condition and you moving out stresses her out and that's gonna make her heart condition worse. Or don't go out with your friends because you know your dad has a temper and that's gonna make him angry and he's gonna take it out on all of us. So instead of the parent getting the help that they need in order to manage their health, that burden is now placed on the child who doesn't have much control over the situation to begin with, but now feels responsible for all of it. And that can cause a child to constantly operate from a place of fear, guilt, and shame. They may become people pleasers. They may start to ignore their own needs because they're constantly putting everyone else's wellbeing in front of their own. They may start to lose their sense of self because they feel like what they need and want doesn't matter. And this doesn't just affect their relationships at home. These effects are carried into other relationships. So whether it's friends, romantic, coworkers, it doesn't matter. All I'm saying is that there is a difference between being empathetic, compassionate, supportive, and caring towards your parents' problems versus being responsible for their problems. You have permission to let go of that responsibility. That burden is not yours to carry.","I feel like this isn't talked about enough.

146,thescenenewyork,C7PiUZZvKm4,,"POV: You‚Äôre on the ‚ÄúHow I Built This: Social Media Growth‚Äù Panel, at The Slashie Summit, hosted @shopify HQ in SoHo. 

@slashieconnects is one of my all time favorite weekends in NYC. It‚Äôs a yearly summit that celebrates South Asian creators, entrepreneurs & small businesses. This was the 5th Slashie Summit of all time, my third time in attendance & second time as a speaker. 

My last Slashie, I was not a speaker but a vendor. The Scene had a stall at Slashie and we gained 325 sign ups for our web app from our 8 hour long stall. This was the highest sign up day, for our business of all time. 

From that moment, to the year before on the CEO panel, or this year on the How I Built This panel - I literally can‚Äôt thank Slashie & @tsakhuja_walia enough for having us + giving so many more South Asian voices a platform.

(Also on a personal note - If It wasn‚Äôt for Slashie I wouldn‚Äôt have met @thezubairshow and therefore my life would be half as exciting so thank you Slashie for giving me one of my closest friends).

We got the following cocktails:

- lychee lovers : delicious, with hints of rose
- Vodka masala : so good and so different than anything we‚Äôve tried
- Old fashioned : delicious and a moment for your instagram

For apps we got the:
- Khasta Gobi

This is a great spot for happy hour with friends post work or to go out on the weekend. Personally we think it‚Äôs rare to find a spot that does bottle service, great happy hours, etc. and still does delicious craft cocktails - and the highlight room absolutely wins for us there. They also have gorgeous panoramic views of the city - despite living here 11 years, we were mesmerized. (PS: They also offer an amazing Happy Hour every¬†Tuesday - Friday from 5PM - 9PM with $5 ros√©.)
.
The perfect itinerary would be to come here around 6/7pm and have an absolute blast as the party turns up till 9/10pm, with their live DJs. Then head downstairs to the restaurant at the same hotel, Sake No Hana for dinner & drinks or the Silver Lining Lounge (also at the Moxy) and then to Loosies for clubbing right next door‚ú®

Personally we love that they took out the ‚Äústuffiness‚Äù typically associated with live band performances, where the guests usually can‚Äôt talk or have a word of their own. The band was most definitely the center of attention, but in a fun and casual way, where the guests also had a chance to talk amongst themselves and not to mention the band members themselves were interacting with the audience the whole evening as well.

182,thescenenewyork,C5jQq22P4Kn,,"OK, but seriously what is it with laptop free caf√©s especially and we repeat especially when literally no one is sitting inside the caf√© and it is completely empty? 

Caf√© Kitsun√© is cute and serves a good coffee. The aesthetics are on point. We don‚Äôt even need to say it. But they literally lost out on a full sale (and okay also what would have otherwise been completely positive coverage honestly), because they were super strict on the laptop free rule, even when no one was in the caf√©. 

There are so many great cafes but for the work from home ppl like us, who would love to go to a cafe at a non peak time, and work from there, we come to find out that they are actually laptop free. The question really is should cafes change their laptop free rule to specific times? And should this left to the discretion of the barista, that‚Äôs at the time managing the caf√©? For instance, at a super busy time when the caf√© is full, of course you can have a laptop free rule to maintain turnover + more sales, but in an afternoon on a weekday when there‚Äôs no one in the caf√© maybe they should you allow 45 minute to an hour allowances on laptops being out per customer? We get that adding policing on using laptops is not easy but is it worth it if it‚Äôs going to significantly increase sales when the cafe is otherwise empty. There‚Äôs also a really easy way to police this by disconnecting wifi automatically after 1 hour or 45 mins of usage. 

Anyway - what are your thoughts on laptop free cafes? Love it or hate it?

Honest review - they have some of the best cocktails & bar bites you‚Äôll ever have. We love this spot for post work happy hour or drinks with friends. We esp loved their Spring Blossom Mojito and their Lavender Twist. And ofc we cannot forget their OG drinks and our *OG favorites* the espresso martini flight + their lychee martini!

Happy Hour Details:
They now have a happy hour Monday + Tuesdays from 5 pm to- 7 pm where you can enjoy $12 cocktails + wines and $7 beers.
