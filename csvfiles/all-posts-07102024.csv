charminglystyled,CzSlHGPsjv4,,"Missing these views 🏔️❄️ 

Banff did not disappoint, and I’m already ready to go back! I’ve had a few people ask about where to go, here are a few of my favorite recs 👇🏻

How to get there:
🏔️ Fly into Calgary and rent a car, it’s the easiest way to get around! The drive to Banff is about 1.5 hours, so not too far - and the views are incredible 😍

To stay: 
🏔️ We stayed a few nights at @fairmontbanff to stay in the actual park, and then headed to an AirBnB in Canmore, a cute mountain town outside the park. It’s nice to stay a few nights at a hotel by downtown Banff and then stay somewhere a little cheaper outside the park. Note: if you’re going in the park, just be ready to pay about $20 per day for your parks pass. 

To Hike: 
🏔️ Visit Lake Louise and spend the day hiking to the Tea House or surrounding lakes! But make sure to get to the parking lot when it opens, before 9! We grabbed lunch at @fairmontcll afterwards and it was gorgeous. 

🏔️ Johnston Canyon is another easy hike with beautiful views along a river filled with waterfalls. 

To eat: 
🏔️ We loved @bluebirdbanff for steaks and their famous key lime pie! The crudo was also amazing 🐟 (Banff)

🏔️ @fourtwoninesix had amazing food and really great vegan and vegetarian options - the tofu, southern snow crab and fried mushrooms were so good 🤤 (Canmore)

🏔️ @bridgettebarcanmore was also incredible for pasta and pizza, and the best banana cream pie I’ve ever had 🥧 (Canmore) 

If you have any questions, happy to answer them! I can also recommend a few backcountry camping hikes if you’re looking for something more adventurous 😉",171,posts/charminglystyled\2023-11-06_03-57-11_UTC.jpg,posts/charminglystyled\2023-11-06_03-57-11_UTC.jpg,2023-11-06 03:57:11,GraphImage,[],False

There’s lots of tears (usually in the shower as it’s falling out) a feeling that your hairbrush is out to get you, and a ping of sadness every time you see loose hairs fall out - which happens what feels like every moment of every day. I’ve gone from a pixie cut, to long hair, to thickening extensions, to half of my hair, to short hair again, and have tried most “magical hair serums” on the block. The sadness of watching your hair fall out is all consuming, and I can’t imagine having to deal with that kind of stress in the public eye like Jada, knowing how emotionally taxing it can be in a private life. 

Slapping anyone is never not OK, but also making a joke on something so deeply personal in front of millions of people is also pretty terrible too.
