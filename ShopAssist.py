    Users of instagram (or any social platform) have great difficulty searching and finding products featured in posts or stories shared by 
    their favorite influencers. Instagram and other social media applications have limited search 
    functionality. We've all been there, We liked the lipgloss (or smartwatch) an influencer reviewed last week, 
    we're at the store now, and we're scanning through countless posts before finally finding the post
    we wanted. 
    Why cant you search through influencer posts? Well, Google does not Index social media sites ( Instagram
    is a walled gardens) and Instagram Search is really bad [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/vjq7bc/instagram_search_sucks_any_ways_to_get_around_its/). 
    
    Social media companies have no incentive to improve search on their platforms, more time users spend on the platform = more ad revenues.
    
    We thought we could do better.  ShopAssist lets you talk to your influencer and search through their posts. Try it out now!

    This is limited demo, restricted to only posts data from the last 50 posts.  It was put together by non developers in less than a week as a POC for something bigger.
    Email me at [(jcvdevacc@gmail.com)] for more details on the project or if you want to collaborate.  We're working to improve the social 
    commerce experience for consumers, while providing influencers incremental sales revenue.
