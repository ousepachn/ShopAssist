    We've all been there, We liked the lipgloss (or smartwatch) an influencer reviewed last week, 
    we're at the store now, and we're scanning through countless posts before finally giving up in frustration!!

    Why is it so hard to search through influencer posts? Well, Google does not Index social media sites ( Instagram
    is a walled gardens) and Social platform content search is really bad [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/vjq7bc/instagram_search_sucks_any_ways_to_get_around_its/). 
    
    Social media companies have no incentive to improve search on their platforms, more time users spend on the platform = more ad revenues.
